As someone who is interested in both creative writing and frontend development, I developed this project as both a resource for me to compile and view the poems I write and as an opportunity to develop experience with React, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and other relevant frontend technologies. In developing this project, I started from this tutorial ( https://youtu.be/ulOKYl5sHGk?si=6jokC7Y5soiQIqad ) on building a web application for creating, updating, and viewing notes. Through this tutorial, I was able to gain a greater understanding of how to use and send React component properties, how to leverage hooks in React, and how to utilize CSS for styling. Additionally, through this experience I learned how to leverage localStorage to save the data entered in the website even after closing and reopening the website. After this, I used my knowledge of css to reformat and style the website to better fit my desired color scheme. After watching this tutorial on implementing the 'File Upload' feature in React ( https://youtu.be/O4ybhvtUbCE?si=Yofc_ISCY65GGmkl  ), I implemented this feature within my website to make it possible for a unique image to be uploaded for each poem. In the process of integrating and implementing all my desired features for this application, I gained a greater familiarity with HTML, React, Javascript, and localStorage, and I got experience with utilizing console.log() for debugging.

With this application, a user can add/delete any poem from the sidebar on the left hand side. After adding at least one poem, a user can select any poem from the sidebar and view that particular poem within the main page of the website. They can edit the selected poem and add a file to the poem, and these changes will be saved automatically. The poems are sorted in order of their last update times, so the most recently updated poems will be displayed at the top of the sidebar.
