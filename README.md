As someone who is interested in both creative writing and frontend development, I developed this project as both a resource for me to compile and view the poems I write and as an opportunity to develop experience with React, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and other relevant frontend technologies. In developing this project, I started from this tutorial ( https://youtu.be/ulOKYl5sHGk?si=6jokC7Y5soiQIqad ) on building a web application for creating, updating, and viewing notes. Through this tutorial, I was able to gain a greater understanding of how to use and send React component properties, how to leverage hooks in React, and how to utilize CSS for styling. Additionally, through this experience I learned how to leverage localStorage to save the data entered in the website even after closing and reopening the website. After this, I used my knowledge of css to reformat and style the website to better fit my desired color scheme. After watching this tutorial on implementing the 'File Upload' feature in React ( https://youtu.be/O4ybhvtUbCE?si=Yofc_ISCY65GGmkl  ), I implemented this feature within my website to make it possible for a unique image to be uploaded for each poem. In the process of integrating and implementing all my desired features for this application, I gained a greater familiarity with HTML, React, Javascript, and localStorage, and I got experience with utilizing console.log() for debugging.
